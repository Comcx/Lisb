** DONE Notations [5/5]
*** DONE Sets
*** DONE Family
*** DONE Numbers
*** DONE Functions
*** DONE Logarithms and exponentials

** NEXT Integers [1/2]
*** DONE Divisibility
**** DONE Definition
**** DONE Propertity
- Transitive: a | b and b | c => a | c
- Self: a | a
- Distributive: a | b and a | c => a | (b + c)
- Sign: a | b => (-a) | b and a | (-b)
- Special: forall a, 1 | a and a | 0
- Size: if a | b then 1 <= |a| <= |b|  
- Equivalence: a | b and b | a => a = b or a = (-b)

*** NEXT Primality
_Note_: /whenever we speak of a prime or composite number, we mean a positive integer./ 

**** DONE Definition
**** DONE Composites => not prime
**** NEXT *Fundamental theorem of arithmetic*
_Every integer can be expressed as a unique product of primes_ 
***** DONE Proof
****** DONE A basic proof
The uniqueness proof part is the hard part...

**** TODO Division with remainder property
